#+TITLE: Intallation of AWS Cli Interface

* Install

Basically follow [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html][Amazon's instructions]], but use the option to install to a bin directory in my home instead.

#+begin_src sh
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
./aws/install -i $HOME/sw/aws-cli -b $HOME/sw/bin
#+end_src

Note that both the -b and -i options must be provided for the custom location isntall to work.

Test the install

#+begin_src sh
$ aws --version
aws-cli/2.0.24 Python/3.7.3 Linux/5.4.0-37-generic botocore/2.0.0dev28
#+end_src

* Configure

Set up user credentials, using the [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html][configure command]

#+begin_src
aws configure
#+end_src

The credentials are stored in a file

#+begin_src sh
$HOME/.aws/credentials
#+end_src

This file can be edited directly and you can add additional profiles if you have several accounts or contexts. You can also just create the $HOME/.aws directory and copy this file to another computer, but make sure it's permissions are locked down to just your user.

#+begin_src sh
chmod 700 $HOME/.aws
chmod 600 $HOME/.aws/credentials
#+end_src
