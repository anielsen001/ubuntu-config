#+TITLE: gdal and python

I needed to read DTED. GDAL is apparently the preferred solution with python.

I had installed gdal 2.4.0 on my laptop, but that refused to build with a pip install of gdal like this into a python3 venv virtual enviroment.

#+begin_src sh
python3 -m pip install gdal==2.4.0 --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I$HOME/sw/include/"
#+end_src

I upgraded to gdal 2.4.4 and the pip install went smoothly
#+begin_src sh
python3 -m pip install gdal==2.4.4 --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I$HOME/sw/include/"
#+end_src
