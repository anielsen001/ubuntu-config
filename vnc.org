#+TITLE: VNC configuration

* viewer

install the viewer

#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install tigervnc-viewer
#+end_src

use ssh to tunnel the remote port over to the local system. Here XX is the port number associated with the vnc server on the remote system.

#+begin_src sh
ssh -L 59XX:localhost:59XX -N -f user@host
#+end_src

Start the vncviewer. The encodings help over slower connections, but are only avaialbe with some clients.

#+begin_src sh
xtigervncviewer localhost:XX
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
vncviewer -encodings "copyrect hextile" localhost:XX
#+end_src

* server

make sure conda is not running before starting the server. Conda seems to steal the dbus and create problmes. 

General configuration depends upon the system running the server. The following seems to work OK.

#+begin_src sh
vncserver -geometry 1298x950 :99
#+end_src

The server can be killed with

#+begin_src sh
vncserver -kill :99
#+end_src
