#+TITLE: PAM configuration

* lock account after incorrect login attempts

https://www.linuxtechi.com/lock-user-account-incorrect-login-attempts-linux/

The yubikey section must come first, if included, followed by this. 

These edits are made in /etc/pam.d/common-auth

#+begin_src 
# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
auth    required                        pam_tally2.so onerr=fail deny=5 unlock_time=60 audit
auth    [success=1 default=ignore]      pam_unix.so nullok_secure
#+end_src

The pam tally count can be checked with
#+begin_src
sudo pam_tally2 --user=<user>
#+end_src

and reest with

#+begin_src
sudo pam_tally2 --user=<user> --reset
#+end_src

The counter needs to be reset or you'll always exceed the counter limit and get locked.

The counter can be automatically reset on success by adding the following line to /etc/pam.d/common-account at the beginning
#+begin_src
account     required      pam_tally2.so
#+end_src
