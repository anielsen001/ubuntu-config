#+TITLE: Group management

Users can be added via the Users panel in Settings, but you cannot control groups this way. 

* New groups

New groups can be added with 
#+begin_src
sudo groupadd <group>
#+end_src

* Adding user to existing group

#+begin_src sh
sudo usermod -a -G <group> <user>
#+end_src

The -a flag is essential to append groups to the user, otherwise their list of groups is replaced with this group. <group> can be a comma separated list of groups.

Adding someone to a group won't take effect unless they log back in. You can use
#+begin_src sh
newgrp <group>
#+end_src
to add the group for the current session
