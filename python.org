#+TITLE: python

Usually build python from scratch. 

This will install the required libraries:
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev ncurses-dev uuid-dev
sudo apt install build-essential libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev tk-dev
sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev lzma-dev libgdbm-compat-dev lzma
#+end_src

* Python 3

Current release found at [[https://python.org]]

#+begin_src sh
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/Python-3.8.3.tar.xz
#+end_src 

Build python and install it into a user directory:
#+begin_src sh
./configure --prefix=$HOME/sw --enable-shared --enable-optimizations --with-ensurepip=upgrade
make -j12
make install
#+end_src

* Python 2.7

It was end of life on 1 Jan 2020, but it's still a zombie.

#+begin_src sh
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/
#end_src

I always had problems building python 2.x with more than one thread.

#+begin_src sh
./configure --prefix=$HOME/sw --enable-optimizations --with-ensurepip=yes --enable-shared LDFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath=/home/apn/sw/lib
make
#+end_src
