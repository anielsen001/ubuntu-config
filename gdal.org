#+TITLE: GDAL and python

I needed to read DTED. GDAL is apparently the preferred solution with python.

* Ubnutu 20.04

- There is a ppa (sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa), but as of today (2020-07-03) there is not support for ubuntu 20.04.
- The default focal repos contain gdal 3.0.4 and can be installed with
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install gdal-bin
sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev
#+end_src

GDAL can be installed into a virtual environment with:

#+begin_src sh
export VENV_DIR=$PWD/venv-dir/
python3 -m venv $VENV_DIR
source $VENV_DIR/bin/activate

# numpy must be installed first
# https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/153199/import-error-no-module-named-gdal-array/274328
python3 -m pip install numpy

python3 -m pip install gdal==3.0.4 
#+end_src

* Ubuntu 18.04

Followed building instructions for 2.4.4 as below

* Ubuntu 16.04

I had installed gdal 2.4.0 on my laptop, but that refused to build with a pip install of gdal like this into a python3 venv virtual enviroment.

#+begin_src sh
python3 -m pip install gdal==2.4.0 --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I$HOME/sw/include/"
#+end_src

I upgraded to gdal 2.4.4 and the pip install went smoothly
#+begin_src sh
python3 -m pip install gdal==2.4.4 --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I$HOME/sw/include/"
#+end_src
