#+TITLE: python

Usually build python from scratch. 

This will install the required libraries:
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev ncurses-dev uuid-dev
sudo apt install build-essential libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev tk-dev
sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev lzma-dev libgdbm-compat-dev lzma
#+end_src

Build python and install it into a user directory:
#+begin_src sh
./configure --prefix=$HOME/sw --enable-shared --enable-optimizations --with-ensurepip=upgrade
make -j12
make install
#+end_src
