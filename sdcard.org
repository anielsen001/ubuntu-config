WARNING: Probing normally takes from a few seconds to 15 minutes, but
         it can take longer. Please be patient.

Good news: The device `/dev/mmcblk0' is the real thing

Device geometry:
	         *Usable* size: 59.69 GB (125173760 blocks)
	        Announced size: 59.69 GB (125173760 blocks)
	                Module: 64.00 GB (2^36 Bytes)
	Approximate cache size: 0.00 Byte (0 blocks), need-reset=no
	   Physical block size: 512.00 Byte (2^9 Bytes)

Probe time: 1'16"
 Operation: total time / count = avg time
      Read: 246.3ms / 4816 = 51us
     Write: 1'15" / 4192321 = 17us
     Reset: 0us / 1 = 0us
