The IDE needs python3 and pyserial installed. But seems to try and use python2. I created a virtual environment with python3 and then install pyserial into the venv. Then activate the venv and run arduino.
#+begin_src sh
python3 -m venv venv_arduino
source venv_arduino/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install pyserial
arduino
#+end_src

the user must be in the dialout group as well to interact via serial connection
#+begin_src sh
sudo adduser <user> dialout
#+end_src
The user will have to log out and log back in for the change to take effect.
