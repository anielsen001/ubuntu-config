#+TITLE: autofs configuration

* auto.master

Edit the /etc/auto.master file. on 20.04, I did not have to do anything other than add lines to specific nfs server mounts at the end

Add a line that refers to the mount point and the file that describes what to mount. 

For example:
#+begin_src 
/mnt/syn    /etc/auto.syn
#+end_src

/mnt/syn refers to a directory tree where the mounts points will be mounted under.

/etc/auto.syn is a file that describes what to mount unter /mnt/syn

* auto.syn

auto.syn contains lines that describe what to mount under the directory tree

For example:
#+begin_src
homes -fstype=nfs server-name:/volume1/homes
#+end_src

will mount the /volume1/homes from nfs server-name to /mnt/syn/homes

* reload the autofs service

#+begin_src
sudo systemctl reload autofs.service
#+end_src
